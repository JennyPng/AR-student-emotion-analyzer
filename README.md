# AR-student-emotion-analyzer
Understanding where students struggle is crucial in providing a good educational experience,
yet many students suffer in silence, making it difficult for instructors to adjust.

We propose a context-aware AR system that utilizes real-time computer vision to analyze student engagement
and understanding, dynamically providing suggestions on how to adjust the teaching pace and
focus areas.
